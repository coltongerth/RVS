Rangeland Vegetation Simulator

RVS provides a suite of modules which simulate non-forested project areas' vegetation conditions over time. 
RVS includes calculations for biomass, succession, disturbance, and fuel modelling. The RVS API is generally 
used in conjunction with the Forest Vegetation Simulator, found at http://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/fvs/ and 
https://code.google.com/p/open-fvs/

RVS is still in early production and not ready for release.
