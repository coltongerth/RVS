Rangeland Vegetation Simulator

RVS provides a suite of modules which simulate non-forested project areas' vegetation conditions over time. RVS includes calculations for biomass, succession, disturbance, and fuel modelling. The RVS API is best used in conjunction with the Forest Vegetation Simulator, found at http://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/fvs/ and https://code.google.com/p/open-fvs/
